# 2022-06-13:Ecfun:
# GitHub Actions: Win and macOS (release) plus 
# ubuntu-20.04 (devel, release & oldrel): OK
#
# Winbuilder-oldrel and -devel identified "(possibly) invalid URLs"
# or with "Service Unavailable" 
# that worked on other platforms and for me locally.   
# 
# Also, Winbuilder-release:  
# Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(url, handle = h) : 
#   Failed FTP upload: 550
# and 'Warning: <table> attribute "width" not allowed for HTML5'.
# Ben Bolker replied to a question to R-pkg-devel about this, saying, 
# Hopefully this will be fixed in R 4.2.1 (scheduled for June 23)".
